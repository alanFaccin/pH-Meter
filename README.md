# pH-Meter

A pH-Meter based on a pic16f876a and a ADS1015 ADC

This project was created as a final year project and thesis.


The purpose of this project is to creare a pH-meter with specifications similar to marketed products.
During development it has been chosen to kept the hardware as modern and concise as possible. When available, modern ICs have been chosen over legacy alternatives, giving space to a state-of-the-art software configurable ADC and ultra-high specs op-amp. [more info in the general hardware description].
The goals of the project were chosen at it’s genesis, and nearly no compromise has been taken during development and design.
An handheld shape has been chosen for the instrument. While a wooden case (CNC machined) is preferred, a 3d printed PLA case is also an available and acceptable solution.

Technical specifications:
• Shape: Handheld tool
• Power source: AA/AAA battery
• Concurrent measurement and display of both pH and temperature • Standard BNC connection for brand-less pH probes
• Temperature resolution better than 0.1°C
• pH resolution of at least 0.1pH
• Easily readable LCD display with firmware control
• Differential measurement mode (delta - Δ)
