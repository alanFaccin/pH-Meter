 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is realy just two files: 'printf.h' and 'printf.c'.

The formats supported by this implementation are: 'd' 'u' 'c' 's' 'x' 'X'.

Zero padding and field width (limited to 255) are also supported.

The memory foot print of course depends on the target cpu, compiler and 
compiler options, but a rough guestimate (based on a HC08 target) is about 
600 - 1100 bytes for code and some twenty bytes of static data.  Note
that this printf is not re-entrant. 

Note that the code expects that int size is 16 bits, and that char is
8 bits.

For further details see source code.
